**Background:** Although several workflows are currently available for academic
poster preparation, none of them are ideal.
Commonly, point-and-click software is used to arrange poster content,
regardless of the analysis pipeline.
Most of these software tools are propietary, thus trapping our content.
Typical free and script based tools such as $\LaTeX$ might not be appealing
or seem as complex as using a point-and-click tool.
This work shows a simple template to prepare posters in a free and reproducible
workflow using R, rmarkdown, flexdashboard and webshot.




## Row 2 {data-height=75}

### **Methods**

#### Sample data

Datasets included in package `datasets`



#### Workflow

**Dependencies**

This poster template dependes on the following R packages

- rmarkdown [@rmarkdown]
- flexdashboard [@flexdashboard]
- webshot [@webshot]

To use `scripts/generic-content` you will need a GNU/Linux system
and a working installation of `imagemagick`.


**Preparing your analysis environment**

In order to use this poster template, you need to:

1. Install the required packages  
  `install.packages("rmarkdown", "flexdashboard", "webshot")`
2. Install the PhantomJS library `webshot::install_phantomjs()`
3. Edit the template to fit your needs
4. Run `scripts/render-poster.R`


#### Hosting your poster

You can host the poster generated by this template in GitHub pages
by checking out the contents of the `content` directory in in the
root directory of the `gh-pages` branch:

```{}
## complete commiting your updates then move to gh-pages
git checkout gh-pages

# Only checkout specific files
git checkout develop content/*
git checkout develop output/*

# Copy files and clean up
cp -r content/* . && rm -R content/*
rmdir content
git rm --cached

# Add contents, commit and publish
git add * output/*
git commit -m 'Update published poster'
git push origin gh-pages
```


### **Results**

Here you would describe some amazing results.
Since this poster is about making a poster, I show the poster we last made.

**Fig. 1: Even the wisest cannot tell. For the mirror… shows many things…**
<img src="../output/poster.png" alt="What will I see?" style="width:100%"></img>



```{r volcano-plot, fig.width=6, fig.height=3}
# Prepare a figure for later use
filled.contour(volcano)
```



#### Reproducible results with R

As we have come to expect, results from R computations can be included as well.
Since adjusting figure positions will be almost always necesary,
figures are by default saved to `content/` and not shown on the poster.
You need to manually include them using a <img> tag as shown below.

```html
**Fig. 1: Place the volcano figure where you please.**
<img src="../output/volcano-plot-1.png" style="width:100%"></img>
```


#### Output for printing

A png file is produced by `scripts/render-poster.R`.
By default it is set to use a 300ppi resolution and A3 size.
For now, some testing is necessary to adjust scale and poster size.


### Discussion


```{r new-standard}
# Get reference image
download.file(
  "https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/standards.png", mode = "wb",
  destfile = "../output/standards.png"
)
```


Since there are so many tools that can be used to prepare posters,
and not a single one satisfies my needs,
I prepared this *other* tool to... nah it still is missing things.

**Fig. 3: Some authoritative content**
<img src="../output/standards.png" style="width:100%"></img>


#### Limitations

Since the png file is generated as a snapshot of the html poster,
several limitations should be considered:

- Resolution is very limited by the resources in your system
- Larger formats require much more resources to render
- Complex posters can take longer to load, so you have to try different delays
- The preview shown in `poster/poster_frame.html` could be very different to
the final rendered image
